#### Intro
This repository documents my journey of learning Machine Learning with Andrew Wu, including code and lecture slides. 


#### Reference
[Machine Learning](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1owrpYKEtP/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)  The machine learning course taught by Andrew Wu starts from the most fundamental topics such as linear regression and gradient descent, and progresses to deep learning, reinforcement learning, as well as explanations of some tree models. The lectures are clear and refreshing, making it an excellent introductory course. <br>
